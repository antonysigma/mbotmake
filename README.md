# mbotmake

A gcode to .makerbot conversion tool, compatible with Marlin gcode from Cura.
And likely others.

**This is a fork that works for the Makerbot Replicator+**, and it is unclear if
it still works for the 5th Generation. See the original repository if you have
a 5th gen.

# Usage

It's a Python script that generates a .makerbot file from a .gcode file that is
passed as an argument on the command line.

You are almost guaranteed to have to understand the makerbot file format
anyway, so just read the code.
